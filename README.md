# File Operations in Java


🌟 Welcome to the fascinating world of File Operations in Java! 🚀

Here, you'll find a curated collection of projects that showcase various file manipulation techniques. From `PrintStream` to `PrintWriter` and even serialization, these projects will empower you to work with files in Java like a pro! 📂🖋️🔍


In Java, a File is an abstract data type. A named location used to store related information is known as a File. There are several File Operations like creating a new File, getting information about File, writing into a File, reading from a File and deleting a File.

Before understanding the File operations, it is required that we should have knowledge of Stream and File methods. If you have knowledge about both of them, you can skip it.

# Stream
A series of data is referred to as a stream. In Java, Stream is classified into two types, i.e., Byte Stream and Character Stream.

# Byte Stream
Byte Stream is mainly involved with byte data. A file handling process with a byte stream is a process in which an input is provided and executed with the byte data.

# Character Stream
Character Stream is mainly involved with character data. A file handling process with a character stream is a process in which an input is provided and executed with the character data.

## Projects Included

1. **PrintStream** 📄: This project demonstrates how to leverage the power of `PrintStream` to write formatted data to files. Whether you want to print text, numbers, or create custom output, you'll discover practical examples to master this class.

2. **PrintWriter** 📝: Dive into the `PrintWriter` project to explore its capabilities in writing data to files. Learn how to create elegant and well-formatted text files, append content to existing files, and handle any exceptions that may arise.

3. **Serialization** 🧪: Uncover the magic of object serialization with this project. Understand how to convert objects into byte streams and save them to files for later retrieval. You'll also discover tips for handling compatibility across different versions of your code.


## Getting Started

To embark on your file operations journey, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Shubh2-0/File_Operations_in_Java.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory of your choice:

   ```
   cd File_Operations_in_Java/Project_Name
   ```

3. Compile and run the Java source files using your preferred IDE or command line tools.

4. Let your creativity flow! Explore the source code, experiment with different file operations, and modify the projects to suit your needs. ✨👩‍💻👨‍💻
