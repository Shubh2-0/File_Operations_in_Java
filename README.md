# File Operations in Java

In Java, a File is an abstract data type. A named location used to store related information is known as a File. There are several File Operations like creating a new File, getting information about File, writing into a File, reading from a File and deleting a File.

Before understanding the File operations, it is required that we should have knowledge of Stream and File methods. If you have knowledge about both of them, you can skip it.

# Stream
A series of data is referred to as a stream. In Java, Stream is classified into two types, i.e., Byte Stream and Character Stream.

# Byte Stream
Byte Stream is mainly involved with byte data. A file handling process with a byte stream is a process in which an input is provided and executed with the byte data.

# Character Stream
Character Stream is mainly involved with character data. A file handling process with a character stream is a process in which an input is provided and executed with the character data.
